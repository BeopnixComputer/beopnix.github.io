              <p>
                 <span>The Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) Mexicali unit only had careers such as: Sociology, Pedagogy and Accounting. At that time there was no Engineering School, which was very necessary for Baja California. For the accelerated growth of the city, industry and agriculture of Mexicali Valley required a large number of engineers to cover various areas under the entity development.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>If someone wanted to study engineering, they had to travel to cities like: Mexico, Guadalajara, Hermosillo or Monterrey. The young “cachanillas” students, who wanted to enter the UNAM, Polytechnic, Guadalajara University, Unison, Technologic of Monterrey, etc., to engineering careers, encountered a problem since they were prevented or made difficult to access, due to the fact that in Mexicali exist a university that did not have such careers and it was not able to accept them. </span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>The University authorities and a group of engineers, mostly civilians together with other professionals were commissioned to study the state needs in educational matters, specially for this branch of science. Its conclusions in the end were: Engineering school needed to start because they found a lot of reasons to create it within the legal UABC framework.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>Once it was created with Mr. Rafael Soto Gil being the current dean of UABC, he appointed Luís I. López Moctezuma Torres as its principal. Motivated by Engineer López Moctezuma, these professionals made the Engineering school project come true, giving rise to the career of Surveyor Engineer and Geodest. The work began with an enrollment of nineteen students and a staff of eight teachers, being the following:</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Due to problems with high school students on September 17, 1968; Engineering school was installed in a building on Avenida Colón known familiarly as the stables and it was an improvised building lacking in functionality, but even so, it was the first building Engineering school owned. On October 14, 1968, the second school cycle of the Surveyor Engineer and Geodest career began in that place.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>The engineer Luis I. López Moctezuma was appointed like definitive principal of Engineering school and the academic vice-principal was Engineer Gabriel Navarro Cuevas. The selection was made from the shortlist made up of the engineers: Luis López Moctezuma, Jorge Padilla Villanueva and the architect Marco Aurelio Sandoval, with Rafael Soto Gil still being their UABC dean.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Then, our principal founder Ing. Luis I. López Moctezuma was appointed as the Autonomous University of Baja California dean, who upon taking his new position designates engineer Isaias Romano Pérez as provisional Engineering school principal on November 25, 1971.
                 </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                 <span>Engineering school as we mentioned was born at the UABC in October 1967. As a consequence of the first stage of the university development planning studies that were undertaken by the Rectory and carried out by professionals, researchers, teachers, students and Authorities of the UABC itself. According with the Planning Center of the National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education (ANUIES), who indicated the pattern to be followed in the opening of new careers, schools and research institutes.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>These works culminated from 1968 to 1971 with the Agricultural Sciences, Architecture and Tourism school’s constitution. Accounting school and Medicine school in Mexicali, revealed to us that it was urgent to undertake a new chapter in university development with the establishment of Schools in those students obtained the knowledge and techniques that would allow the application of scientific knowledge and the use of matter and energy sources.</span>

                 <span>In 1971, was called "First Cultural Engineering Week" and was held on May 26, 27 and 28. From that year on it is repeated annually. Those in charge of organizing the Cultural Engineering Week are student’s society and teachers with the undisputed support of the school principal.</span>

                <h1 class="display-6 text-gradient-blueochre history-years"> <span class="spanyear-trasnparent">1972 year</span></h1>  
              <p>
                 <span>On May 2, 1972, the new university facilities built on the land belonging to the University on Benito Juárez road were inaugurated and the location of Engineering school was changed to the north building. There it shared the second floor together with the Architecture school, being the first floor occupied by the Accounting School and also by the University Library. In this building Mechanical Electrical Engineer career began in September 1972, with an initial enrollment of 64 students.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>University growth makes necessary a provisional change of our School to the semi-finished buildings that were destined for laboratories and workshops of the same school and on October 11, 1975 Engineering school was rearranged working in that space until the new university complex was complete. Since February 1977, Engineering Faculty is located there because during those years three floors were for them and the Architecture school was only at the 4th floor. </span>
              </p>  
              <p>
                 <span>In July 1977 the First Generation of Mechanical Electrical Engineers graduated, which was sponsored by Guillermo Montes Jiménez and was made up of 22 graduates in the Electrical area, 12 in the Mechanical area and 2 in the Electronics area.</span>

                <h1 class="display-6 text-gradient-blueochre history-years"> <span class="spanyear-trasnparent">1986 year</span></h1>  
              <p>
                 <span>In 1986 Architecture school obtained its own building leaving the entire building for Engineering school. As more careers were opened enrollment increases and there was a need to expand  facilities, so the university builds classrooms in a building that shares with Accounting, Architecture and other schools. Then the Languages Center shared workshops and laboratories with Engineering school and it was moved to its own building leaving all the spaces to the current Faculty, which was more prepared according to that time needs.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>From 1993 to 1995, the study plans were restructured in all majors changing from what was called the Rigid Plan to the Flexible Plan. Laboratories equipment continues and computers were acquired for different careers coordinators. The first three "International Engineering Symposium" were held with the participation of some of the school's careers. In 1997 the Industrial Engineering career was opened and the Telecommunications Specialty was reopened. Changes from School to Faculty was made when the Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering and later the Master's Degree in Industrial Processes were created, also achieving the connection with the world information network (internet).</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>Postgraduate studies appeared and the they more spaces, currently having these specialties in telecommunications and masters and doctorates in a program called MyDCI (Master's and Doctorate in Sciences and Engineering). In 2000 the Master in Industrial Processes was opened and in 2003 the Master and Doctorate program in Sciences and Engineering (MyDCI). Currently this program is recognized as a quality program by the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT).</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>Engineering Faculty needed to have accredited laboratories and certified careers, for that reason ISO 9001: 2000 certification work began on five laboratories belonging to the Mechanical, Civil, Electronic, Topography and Computer engineering careers; achieving this certification in September 2003. After two years of continuous work of teachers and laboratory assistants in the same year study plans for all these careers were also restructured and were designed by competences.</span>
              </p>    
               <p>
                 <span>Along with the certification work, in 2002 the process for the accreditation before CACEI of the Educational Programs (PE) offered by the Faculty began; during the mentioned process all the teachers and each of the PEs actively participate. Subsequently, after two years of hard and efficient work, the final document arrived and they got a satisfactory compliance with all the guidelines established by the accreditation Institutions. Engineering Faculty received their Certificate of Accreditation in February 2004.</span>
              </p>    
               <p>
                 <span>In 2004-2 school year, the organization of the Engineering faculty is as follows: all students entering into Engineering faculty need to go through the Common Core, where there are 15 compulsory subjects that can be taken in three or four semesters at the latest. Then apply for admission to what will be his specialty, which can be: Civil Engineer, Industrial Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Electronic Engineer, Computer Engineering, Mechatronics Engineer, Aerospace Engineering, Renewable Energy Engineering, and finally Bioengineering. On the other hand, the Bachelor of Computer Systems program is offered and does not share the Common Core with the rest of the careers, because its basic subjects are different from the rest of the educational programs. All students get a tutor who guides and leads them in the Common Core stage and a new one who attends to them in the specialty.</span>

                 <span>During the recent management since to 2017 until now, this administration worked on the construction of a Quality Management System (QMS). There is a way of working based on processes and sub-processes establishing assistants in educational programs to support the RPE work, in order to improve their development. Leading auditors were prepared under the ISO 9001: 2015 standard, laying some work foundations for the Faculty under a regulatory framework of quality management.</span>
              </p>    
               <p>
                 <span>Some projects with young people from previous levels was an activity of great impact. The linking with previous levels area was created with STEAM activities development focused on students from preschool to high school seeking to create vocations for engineering area. These actions contributed to the skills for the 21st century development. It was committed to the integral development of students and clubs that were held. There young people could in a pleasant and cordial environment with their peers develop artistic and technological activities to improve soft skills. Another aspect to highlight was the realization of sports tournaments like: soccer and basketball allowing students to carry out multiple benefits sports activities.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Ten educational programs were restructured, updating them on the needs of the environment. English I and II learning units were added to the Common Core and courses were given in English. For 2019, ten educational programs of the Faculty received international accreditation, by the Council for the Accreditation of Engineering Education (CACEI), A.C., which belongs to the Washington Accord. The accredited programs are: Computer, Electrical, Electronic, Mechanical, Civil, Industrial, Mechatronics, Bioengineer, Aerospace and Renewable Energy Engineer. Furthermore, this administration managed to maintain the graduate program at the PNC in conjunction with the other academic units belonging to MyDCI.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>It was possible to position the FIM with the recognition by the National Association of Engineering Faculties and Schools (ANFEI) as one of the best engineering institutions in the country in 2019. This recognition was received under category B that groups of Institutions, Faculties and Schools of Engineering in the training of engineers in Mexico.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>Among the linkage actions, work was carried out on the linking committees in function. A Collaboration agreement was established with the "Benemérita Escuela Normal Educadora Rosaura Zapata (BENERZ)" to develop an inter-institutional research project. In addition, the dual model of education was established where students from the educational programs of Industrial Engineer, Electronics Engineer and Graduates in Computer Systems participate.
                 </span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>In compliance with institutional commitments, the FIM sets precedents by establishing the project <bold>"Support program for environmental and social sustainability"</bold> through the academic researchers and students work of the PE: Renewable Energies, who help vulnerable groups through saving and use energy efficiently and water conservation. Success stories were obtained with institutions such as CAHOVA, CAVIM, La Casita, among others. The researchers in charge are Dr. Alejandro Suástegui, Dr. Alexis Acuña and Dra. Marlene Zamora.</span>
